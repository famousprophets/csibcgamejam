A member of the caravan dashes to a horse, and while screaming and hollering and attracting the attention of the entire horde, he rides the horse back in the direction you came from. You lay low for a few more hours, and when daylight breaks, you see only some undead stragglers, which the carvan quickly dispatched. Miraculously, besides the caravaneer who sacrificed himself to lead the horde away, everyone is here and unharmed. You feel that you won't get this lucky again\"

The horde seems to have somehow been expecting this, a second much smaller wave of undead straggling behind pull the horse down, and with it, its rider. Seeing no other option, you stay hidden while your caravan is torn to shreds. By the time morning comes, you are unable to find anyone else. With the horde of undead between you and castle Anatolia, it seems you'll have to survive out here on your own.\"
